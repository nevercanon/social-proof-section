## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

I will include screenshots in my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was particularly difficult for me. The mobile design was fairly easy, but switching to the desktop layout was very hard to figure out for me. I tried positioning my elements with position: relative and position: absolute, but that ended up creating even more problems. I also wanted my page to be more responsive than it was. I'm not used to making the width of my elements grow and shrink with the size of the screen more smoothly. I've only done two different layouts that switch abruptly when the screen size hits the media query breakpoint. This project made me unhappy with that abrupt change, and I want to figure out how to have my pages be even more responsive.

I eventually watched a YouTube video by Kevin Powell of him completing this project so I could get some idea of how to get the layout right. He used a combo of Flexbox, Grid, and transform:translate to get the elements to where they're supposed to be. I ended up completely deleting my first media query attempt and starting over. I used Flexbox and transform:translate. I'm still very uncomfortable with Grid and have never used it in my projects, which I now realize even more is a huge gap in my knowledge that I need to fill.

I also learned more about background sizing and positioning from Kevin Powell's video, and I used the techniques in this project. I'm very happy to have learned this, because the background was giving me a lot of trouble too.

### Continued development

I think it's time for me to stop avoiding Grid. I need to watch more videos on it and practice using it in my projects. It's been hard for me to grasp, but there's no way to learn it if I never use it. I'm also going to work on using min-width and max-width to make my pages more responsive and to make the change between screen sizes more smooth and gradual.

It was beneficial for me to have watched the video of someone more experienced than me building this page, and I think it would be good practice for me to watch videos like that after every project I make, so I can see where I could have been more efficient or learn new techniques and ways of building projects even more professionally.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27WULzr2P8) - This is Kevin Powell's video that helped teach me a lot about layouts and background size and positioning.
- [Resource 2](https://www.degraeve.com/reference/specialcharacters.php) - This is where I got the codes for the open and closing double quotes that I used in the blockquotes.
- [Resource 2](https://www.svgviewer.dev/) - This is what I used to view the SVGs outside of VS code.
